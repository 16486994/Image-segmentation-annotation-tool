# Image-segmentation-annotation-tool
#This tool is a tool for the location recognition network in the method of improving the recognition rate of the verification code.

#The main common energy is to use projection method to automatically segment, segment filter algorithm to clear the segmentation line of noise, manual cutting, automatic removal of the nearest segment, etc. functions will verify the perfect segmentation of code images.

#And according to the X coordinate of the 6 lines cut, the file is named. After convenient cutting, determine the number of cutting positions.
